🎓 I've got a bachelor's degree from the Czech Technical University in Prague. Check out my [thesis](https://github.com/andreondra/bachelor-thesis) and an associated [project](https://github.com/andreondra/use).

📚 Currently I'm studying master's (Computer Science) at the same university.

💼 I had an internship at Microsoft and IBM, worked as a React web developer, full-stack developer, Office lecturer, a teacher of electronics-related tutorials at the Czech Technical University, and more. Check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ondrej-golasowski/).

⚙️ I love computer hardware development, embedded systems, firmware development, and IoT-related stuff. I'm a big fan of RISC-V computer architecture.

🛠️ Currently I work on a research project focused on the practical usage of Linux-based operating systems on the RISC-V platform. I developed a custom RV32I microarchitecture in Verilog. I also work on some other projects, check out my repositories 😄.
